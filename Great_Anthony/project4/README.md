# Project 4 — Baltimore City Homicide Analysis (Scala + Docker)

## Overview
This project fetches and analyzes Baltimore City homicide data (2024 & 2025) directly from **Cham’s Page** using only native Scala and Java libraries.  
The program provides valuable insights for the Mayor’s Office, helping identify homicide trends and demographic patterns.

## Research Questions
1. **Which Baltimore district had the largest spike or drop in homicides between 2024 and 2025?**  
   *Compares yearly counts by district and shows percentage change.*

2. **Which age group (0–17, 18–30, 31–50, 50+) had the most victims across 2024 and 2025?**  
   *Categorizes victims by age range when age data is available.  
   (If no ages are present, the script notes it gracefully.)*
