# PROJECT 6 - Golang Scripts

This project focuses on reprogramming the Scala program from project 5 into a Golang program.

## Differences
Scala is a functional, object-oriented language with inferred type systems and utilizes the JVM. On the other hand, Golang is a procedural language with explicit type systems with its own consistent foundations.

## Usage

```bash
# Make sure script has permission to execute
chmod +x run.sh

# Run with default output
./run.sh

# Run with JSON or CSV outputs
./run.sh --output=json 
./run.sh --output=csv
