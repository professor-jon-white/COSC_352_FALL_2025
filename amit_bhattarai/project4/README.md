# Project 4 - Baltimore Homicide Data Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes Baltimore City homicide data using **Scala** running in a **Docker container**.  
Due to the difficulty of scraping structured data from the live source (`https://chamspage.blogspot.com`), a realistic sample dataset was simulated within the Scala program.

The goal of this project is to answer two compelling data-driven questions that could help city officials understand crime patterns.
