This is a Go (Golang) port of my Project 5. It does the same thing as project difference being it flags using only Goâ€™s standard library.
## Run with Docker
```bash
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh                 # stdout
./run.sh --output=csv    # writes out/q1.csv and out/q2.csv
./run.sh --output=json   # writes out/q1.json and out/q2.json
